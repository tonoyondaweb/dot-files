description: Plan a huge chunk of work (more than one agent session can hold) as a shared map of decision issues on your issue tracker, and resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.

A loose idea has arrived, too big for one agent session, and wrapped in fog: the way from here to the **destination** isn't visible yet. Wayfinding is about finding that way, not charging at the destination. This skill charts the way as a **shared map** on the repo's issue tracker, then works its **decision issues** (questions whose resolution is a decision, not slices of a build to execute) one at a time until the route is clear.

The destination varies per effort, and naming it is the first act of charting: it shapes every issue. It might be a spec to hand off and iterate on, a decision to lock before planning starts, or a change made in place like a data-structure migration. The map is domain-agnostic: engineering work, course content, whatever fits the shape.

## Plan, don't do
Wayfinder is **planning** by default: each issue resolves a decision, and the map is done when the way is clear, with nothing left to decide before someone goes and does the thing. The pull to just do the work is usually the signal you've reached the edge of the map and it's time to hand off. An effort can override this in its **Notes**, carrying execution into the map itself, but absent that, produce decisions, not deliverables.

## Refer by name
Every map and issue has a **name**: its title. In everything the human reads (narration, the map's Decisions-so-far), refer to it by that name, never by a bare id, number, or slug. A wall of `#42, #43, #44` is illegible; names read at a glance. The id and URL don't vanish; a name wraps its link, but they ride _inside_ the name, never stand in for it.

## The Map
The map is a single issue on this repo's issue tracker, labelled `wayfinder:map`, the canonical artifact. Its issues are child issues of the map.

The map is an **index**, not a store. It lists the decisions made and points at the issues that hold their detail; a decision lives in exactly one place, its issue, so the map never restates it, only gists it and links.

**Where the map, its child issues, blocking, and frontier queries physically live is tracker-specific.** GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default tracker for Flow repositories. If `gh` is unavailable, fall back to the local-markdown tracker. Consult the tracker doc's "Wayfinding operations" section for how _this_ repo expresses them.

### The map body
The whole map at low resolution, loaded once per session. Open issues are **not** listed: they are open child issues, found by query.

```markdown
## Destination

<what reaching the end of this map looks like: the spec, decision, or change this effort is finding its way to. One or two lines; every session orients to it before choosing an issue.>

## Notes

<domain; skills every session should consult; standing preferences for this effort>

## Decisions so far

<!-- the index: one line per closed issue, enough to judge relevance, then zoom the link for the detail the issue holds -->

- `<closed issue title>` (<url>): <one-line gist of the answer>

## Not yet specified

<!-- see "Fog of war": in-scope fog you can't issue yet; graduates as the frontier advances -->

## Out of scope

<!-- see "Out of scope": work ruled beyond the destination; closed, never graduates -->
```

### Issues
Each issue is a **child issue** of the map; the tracker's issue id is its identity. Its body is the question, sized to one 100K token agent session:

```markdown
## Question

<the decision or investigation this issue resolves>
```

Each issue carries a `wayfinder:<type>` label, one of `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, `task` (see [Issue Types](#issue-types)).

A session **claims** an issue by assigning it to the dev driving the map, **first**, before any work, so concurrent sessions skip it. That assignee _is_ the claim: an open, unassigned issue is unclaimed.

Blocking uses the tracker's **native** dependency relationship: essential because it renders the frontier _visually_ in the tracker's own UI, so the human sees what's takeable without opening the map. Only a tracker that lacks native blocking falls back to a body convention. An issue is **unblocked** when every issue blocking it is closed; the **frontier** is the open, unblocked, unclaimed children, the edge of the known.

The answer isn't part of the body; it's recorded on resolution (see [Work through the map](#work-through-the-map)). Assets created while resolving an issue are linked from the issue, not pasted in.

## Issue Types
Every issue is either **HITL** (human in the loop, worked _with_ a human who speaks for themselves) or **AFK**, driven by the agent alone. A HITL issue only resolves through that live exchange; the agent never stands in for the human's side of it (a grilling agent that answers its own questions has broken this).

- **Research** (AFK): Reading documentation, third-party APIs, or local resources like knowledge bases to surface a fact a decision waits on. Resolved by a subagent that investigates using the `understand` skill or external documentation. Use when knowledge outside the current working directory is required.
- **Prototype** (HITL): Raise the fidelity of the discussion by making a cheap, rough, concrete artifact to react to (an outline, a rough take, a stub, or UI/logic code) by calling Flow's Prototype playbook (`../flow/playbooks/prototype.md`). Links the prototype as an asset. Use when "how should it look" or "how should it behave" is the key question.
- **Grilling** (HITL): Conversation. The default case. Always invoke the `grill-me` skill, which evaluates the decision against Flow architectural principles. If choices are broad and multi-faceted, run `/to-questionnaire`.
- **Task** (HITL or AFK): Manual work that must happen before a _decision_ can be made: nothing to decide, prototype, or research, but the discussion is blocked until it's done. Signing up for a service so its API can be judged, provisioning access, moving data so its shape can be seen. This is the one type that _does_ rather than decides, and it earns its place by unblocking a decision, not by delivering the destination. The agent drives it alone where it can (AFK); otherwise it hands the human a precise checklist (HITL, optionally via the `/wizard` skill). Resolved when the work is done; the answer records what was done and any resulting facts (credentials location, new URLs, row counts) later issues depend on.

## Fog of war
The map is _deliberately_ incomplete: don't chart what you can't yet see. Beyond the live issues lies the **fog of war**: the dim view of decisions and investigations you can tell are coming but can't yet pin down, because they hang on questions still open. Resolving an issue clears the fog ahead of it, graduating whatever's now specifiable into fresh issues, one at a time, until the way to the destination is clear and no issues remain.

The map's **Not yet specified** section is where that dim view is written down: the suspected question, the area to revisit later. It's the undiscovered frontier _toward_ the destination: everything here is in scope, just not sharp enough to issue. Write as loosely or as fully as the view allows; it doubles as a signpost for collaborators reading where the effort is headed.

**Fog or issue?** The test is whether you can state the question precisely now, _not_ whether you can answer it now.

- **Issue when** the question is already sharp, even if it's blocked and you can't act on it yet.
- **Not yet specified when** you can't yet phrase it that sharply. Don't pre-slice the fog into issue-sized pieces: it's coarser than an issue, and one patch may graduate into several issues, or none, once the frontier reaches it.

**Not yet specified** excludes what's already decided (Decisions so far), what's already a live issue, and what's out of scope (the next section).

## Out of scope
Fog only ever gathers _toward_ the destination. The destination fixes the scope, so work beyond it is **out of scope**: it isn't fog, and it doesn't belong in **Not yet specified**. It gets its own **Out of scope** section on the map: work you've consciously ruled out of _this_ effort. Scope, not sharpness, lands it here.

Out-of-scope work never graduates (the frontier stops at the destination), so it returns only if the destination is redrawn, and then as a fresh effort, not a resumption.

Ruling something out of scope is a scoping act, not a step on the route. When an issue that already exists turns out to sit past the destination (mis-scoped in while charting, or exposed by a resolution), **close it** (a closed issue is unambiguously off the frontier) and leave one line in the **Out of scope** section: the gist plus why it's out of scope, linking the closed issue. It stays out of **Decisions so far**, which records the route actually walked; a scope boundary isn't a step on it.

## Invocation
Two modes. Either way, **never resolve more than one issue per session**, with the exception of research issues.

### Chart the map
User invokes with a loose idea.

1. **Name the destination.** Call `grill-me` to pin down what this map is finding its way to: the spec, decision, or change. The destination fixes the scope, so it's settled first.
2. **Map the frontier.** Grill again, **breadth-first** this time: fan out across the whole space rather than deep on any one thread, surfacing the open decisions and the first steps takeable now. Use the `understand` skill to inspect existing code boundaries if needed. **If this surfaces no fog** (the way to the destination is already clear, the whole journey small enough for one session), you don't need a map. Stop and ask the user how they'd like to proceed.
3. **Create the map** (label `wayfinder:map` via `gh issue create`): Destination and Notes filled in, Decisions-so-far empty, the fog sketched into **Not yet specified**.
4. **Create the issues you can specify now** as child issues of the map, then wire blocking edges in a **second pass** (issues need ids before they can reference each other). Wiring sorts them into the frontier and the blocked; everything you can't yet specify stays in the fog: the **Not yet specified** section.
5. **Fire the research subagents.** For each `research` issue you just created, spin up a subagent to resolve it in parallel, capturing its findings with a context pointer from the issue.
6. Stop: charting is one session's work; it hand-resolves nothing.

### Work through the map
User invokes with a map (URL or number). An issue is **optional**: without one, you pick the next decision, not the user.

1. Load the **map**: the low-res view, not every issue body.
2. Choose the issue. If the user named one, use it. Otherwise take the first frontier issue in order. **Claim it**: assign it to yourself before any work.
3. Resolve it. **Zoom as needed**: fetch the full body of any related or closed issue on demand; invoke `grill-me` on the issue's question.
4. Record the resolution: post the answer as a **resolution comment**, **close** the issue, and **append a context pointer** to the map's Decisions-so-far.
5. Add newly-surfaced issues (create-then-wire); graduate any fog the answer has made specifiable, clearing each graduated patch from **Not yet specified** so it lives only as its new issue. If the answer reveals that an issue (this one or another) sits beyond the destination, **rule it out of scope** rather than resolving it on the route. If the decision invalidates other parts of the map, update or delete those issues.
6. **Destination Reached**: When all issues are resolved and the frontier is empty, hand off to `/to-spec`.
